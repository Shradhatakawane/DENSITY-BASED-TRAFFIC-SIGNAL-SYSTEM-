# DENSITY-BASED-TRAFFIC-SIGNAL-SYSTEM-
A Density Based Traffic Signal System is an intelligent traffic management designed to optimize traffic flow by adjusting signal timings based on real-time vehicle density. This system leverages Infrared (IR) sensors and an ATmega328P microcontroller to dynamically control traffic lights, reducing congestion and improving overalltraffic efficiency.
